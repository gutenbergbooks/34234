LAUS MARIÆ<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is a name like some deep melody<BR>
Hallowed by sundown, delicate as the plash<BR>
Of lonely waves on solitary lakes<BR>
And rounded as the sudden-bursting bloom<BR>
Of bold, deep-throated notes in a midnight cloud<BR>
When shadowy belfries far away roll out<BR>
Across the dark their avalanche of sound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It is a wild voice lost in the wail of the wind;<BR>
The silvery-twinkling plectrum of the rain<BR>
Plays in the poplar tree no other tune<BR>
And pines intone it softly as a prayer<BR>
In leafy litanies.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 5em">The name is raised</SPAN><BR>
Even to God's ear from ancient arches dim<BR>
With caverned twilight and dull altar smoke<BR>
Where tapers weave athwart the azure haze<BR>
Innumerable pageantries of dusk.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Low-voiced and soft-eyed women must they live<BR>
Who bear that holy name.  And now for one<BR>
Time has no other honor than to be<BR>
The meaning of an unremembered rhyme,<BR>
The breath of a forgotten singer's song.<BR>

I must forget awhile the mellow flutes<BR>
And all the lyric wizardry of strings;<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
For I am shaken by the loveliness<BR>
And lights and laughter and beguiling song<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of all this siren world;</SPAN><BR>
The regal beauty of women, round on round,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The swift, lithe slenderness of girls,</SPAN><BR>

So soon, now, I shall lie deep hidden away<BR>

She winded on the castle horn,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">She clamored long and bold,</SPAN><BR>
For she was way-spent and forlorn<BR>

And she stood lonely in the snow.<BR>

From heaven's roof looked down aloof<BR>

She heard the droning drift of snow<BR>

She cried aloud in sudden fright,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The steady beat of mailed feet<BR>

Along the floor.  The castle door<BR>

And the warder strode into his tower<BR>

  WASTE
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Reluctant, groping fog crept gray and cold<BR>
Up from the fields where now the guns were still;<BR>
Far off the thundering surge of battle rolled<BR>
And darkness brooded on the quiet hill;<BR>
Clearly, across the listening night, the shrill<BR>
And rhythmic cry of a lonely cricket fell<BR>
On ears long deafened by the scream of shot and shell.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And there were two who listened wistfully<BR>
To that glad voice, that sad last voice of all,<BR>
Who on the morrow after reveille<BR>
Would make no answer to the muster call;<BR>
Others would eat their mess, others would fall<BR>
When the lines formed again into their places,<BR>
And soon their marching comrades would forget their faces.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
One moaned a little and the other turned<BR>
Painfully sidewise, peering up the bare<BR>
Shell-furrowed slope.  Then, while his deep wound burned,<BR>
He crawled, slow inch by weary inch, to where<BR>
The boy lay,&mdash;young, he thought, and strangely fair.<BR>
"You see, I came," he said.  "It was a wrench.<BR>
I thought I'd die.  Let's have a light here.  What!  You're French!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"No matter ... we'll be going pretty soon...<BR>
Dying 's a lonesome business at the best,<BR>
And when there's nothing but a ghastly moon<BR>
And fog for company, I lose my zest.<BR>
There's a girl somewhere ... well... you know the rest.<BR>
I'm glad I came.  It's hand in hand now, brother.<BR>
I think I laid you here.  I wish 't had been another.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I never meant it, and you did n't mean<BR>
For me this ugly gash along my side.<BR>
Something has pushed us on.  Our slate is clean.<BR>
And long and long after we two have died<BR>
Some learnedest of doctors will decide<BR>
What thing it was.  But we ... we'll never know.<BR>
Our business now 's to help make next year's harvest grow.<BR>

"You've been at school?  College de France!  You know<BR>
Next year I should have heard your Bergson there,&mdash;<BR>
Greatest since Hegel.  Think of Haeckel, though,<BR>
At my own Jena!  Mighty men they were.<BR>
Not mighty enough for what they had to bear.<BR>
They read and wrote and taught, but you and I,<BR>
How have we profited at last?  Well, here we lie.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"If I had known you by the silver Rhine,<BR>
That dreamy country where I had my birth,<BR>
The land of golden corn and golden wine<BR>
And surely, I think, the world's most lovely earth,&mdash;<BR>
I should have loved you, brother, and known your worth.<BR>
But you were born beside the racing Rhone.<BR>
Ah, yes, that made the difference.  That thing alone.<BR>

"We might have fronted this world's stormy weather<BR>
Hand clasped in hand and seeing eye to eye.<BR>
What was there we could not have done together?<BR>

Shoulder to shoulder standing, you and I?<BR>
But now you are slain by me, your unknown friend.<BR>
I die by your unknowing hand.  This ... this is the end!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"And all the love that might have been is blown<BR>
Far off like clouds that fade across the blue;<BR>
The game is over and the night shuts down,<BR>
Blotting the little dreams of me and you<BR>
And all our hope of all we longed to do.<BR>
But courage, comrade!  It's not hard to die.<BR>
It's not so lonely now.  If only we know why!"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The fog-damp folded closer round the hill<BR>
And stillness deepened, but the cricket's song<BR>
Tore at the heavy hem of silence still&mdash;<BR>
One small voice left of love in a world of wrong.<BR>
A few dim stars looked down.  The yelling throng<BR>
Of guns had passed beyond the mountain's brow<BR>
When once again he spoke, but slowly, faintlier now.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Something discovered that it didn't need us&mdash;<BR>
Me in the Fatherland and you in France.<BR>
We were less worth than what it took to feed us,<BR>
And so life gave us only a little glance.<BR>
It's true to say we never had a chance.<BR>
It's like this fog, around, above, below.<BR>
Reach out your hand to me.  Good-night.  We'll never know."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then they lay so still they seemed asleep,<BR>
For death was near and they had little pain.<BR>
The midnight did not hear them moan or weep<BR>
For life and love and gladness lost in vain<BR>
And faces they would never see again,&mdash;<BR>
Old friends, old lovers.  All seemed at a distance.<BR>
The minutes crept and crept.  They made no strong resistance.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They only lay and looked up at the stars,<BR>
Feeling they had not known how fair they were.<BR>
I think their hearts were far from those loud wars<BR>
As they lay listening to the cricket's chirr<BR>
Until it faded to a drowsy blur,<BR>
Dwindled, and died, lost in the distant roar<BR>
Of waves that plunged and broke on some eternal shore.<BR>

THE WATCHER IN THE SKY<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
She has grown pale and spectral with our wounds<BR>
And she is worn with memories of woe<BR>
Older than Karnak.  Multitudinous feet<BR>
Of all the phantom armies of the world<BR>
Resounding down the hollow halls of time,<BR>
Have kept their far-off rumor in her ear.<BR>
For she was old when Nineveh and Tyre<BR>
And Baalbec of the waste went down in blood;<BR>
Pompey and Tamburlaine and Genghis Khan<BR>
Are dreams of only yesternight to her.<BR>
And still she keeps, chained to a loathsome thing,<BR>
Her straining, distant paces up and down<BR>

There where he sits in the cold, in the gloom,<BR>
Of his far-away place by his thundering loom,<BR>
He weaves on the shuttles of day and of night<BR>
The shades of our sorrow and shapes of delight.<BR>
He has wrought him a glimmering garment to fling<BR>
Over the sweet swift limbs of the Spring,<BR>
He has woven a fabric of wonder to be<BR>

He has fashioned in sombre funereal dyes<BR>
A tissue of gold for the midnight skies.<BR>

What thing he is weaving there in the dark.<BR>

I've been wandering, listening for a song,<BR>

And crooned above the cradled stars before they learned to creep.<BR>

O, there was laughter in it and many a merry chime<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where the rivulet swept by a sycamore root<BR>
With a turbulent voice and a hurrying foot,<BR>
I bent by the water and spoke in my dream<BR>
To the wavering, restless, unlingering stream:<BR>
"Oh, turbulent rivulet hastening past,<BR>
For what wonderful goal do you hope at the last<BR>
That never you pause in the shimmering green<BR>
Of the undulant shade where the sycamores lean<BR>
Or rest in the moss-curtained, cool dripping halls<BR>
Hidden under the veils of your musical falls<BR>
Or loiter at peace by the tremulous fern&mdash;<BR>
White wandering waters that never return?"<BR>

And I dreamed by the rivulet's wavering side<BR>
That a myriad ripple of voices replied:<BR>
"Aloft on the mountain, afar on the steep,<BR>
A voice that we knew cried aloud in our sleep,<BR>
'Come, hasten ye down to the vale and to me,<BR>
Your begetter, destroyer, preserver, the Sea!'<BR>
We must carry our feebleness down to the Strong,<BR>
We must mingle us deep in the Whole, and ere long<BR>
All the numberless host of the heaven shall ride<BR>

THE FIRST CHRISTIAN<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A little wandering wind went up the hill.<BR>
It had a lonely voice as though it knew<BR>
What it should find before it came to where<BR>
The broken body of him that had been Christ<BR>
Hung in the ruddy glow.  A bowshot down<BR>
The bleak rock-shouldered hill the soldiery<BR>
Had piled a fire, and when the searching wind<BR>
Came stronger from the distant sea and dashed<BR>
The shadows and the gleam together, songs<BR>
Of battle and lust were blown along the slope<BR>
Mingled with clash of swords on cuisse and shield.<BR>
But of the women sitting by the cross<BR>
Even she whose life had been as gravely sweet<BR>
And sheltered as a lily's did not flinch.<BR>
Her face was buried in her shrouding cloak.<BR>
And she who knew too sorrowfully well<BR>
The cruelty and bitterness of life<BR>
Heard not.  She sat erect, her shadowy hair<BR>
Blown back along the darkness and her eyes<BR>
That searched the distant spaces of the night<BR>
Splendid and glowing with an inward joy.<BR>
And at the darkest hour came three or four<BR>
From round the fire and would have driven them thence;<BR>
But one who knew them, gazing in their eyes,<BR>
Said: "Nay.  It is his mother and his love,<BR>
The scarlet Magdalena.  Let them be."<BR>
So, in the gloom beside that glimmering cross,<BR>
Beneath the broken body of him they loved,<BR>
They wept and watched&mdash;the lily and the rose.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last the deep, low voice of Magdalen,<BR>
Toned like a distant bell, broke on the hush:<BR>
"We are so weak!  What can poor women do?<BR>
So pitifully frail!  God pity us!<BR>
How he did pity us!  He understood...<BR>
Out of his own great strength he understood<BR>
How it might feel to be so very weak...<BR>
To be a tender lily of the field,<BR>
To be a lamb lost in the windy hills<BR>
Far from the fold and from the shepherd's voice,<BR>
To be a child with no strength, only love.<BR>
And ah, he knew, if ever a man can know,<BR>
What 't is to be a woman and to live,<BR>
Strive how she may to out-soar and overcome,<BR>
Tied to this too frail body of too fair earth!<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Oh, had I been a man to shield him then<BR>
In his great need with loving strong right arm!<BR>
One of the twelve&mdash;ha!&mdash;of that noble twelve<BR>

Or else betrayed him ere they ran?  Ah no!<BR>
And yet, a man's strength with a woman's love...<BR>
That might have served him somewhat ere the end."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then with a weary voice the mother said:<BR>

That strong men strive for he passed heedless by.<BR>
Because that he was weak I loved him so...<BR>
For that and for his soft and gentle ways,<BR>
The tender patient calling of his voice<BR>

He was so good a workman ... axe and saw<BR>
Did surely suit him better than a sword.<BR>

"It seems but yesterday he played among<BR>

In golden glory on the boy's bright hair<BR>
And on the shavings that were golden too.<BR>

And will not take the darkling eastward path<BR>

So did her dream cling to the ruined past<BR>
And all the joy they had in Nazareth<BR>
Before the years of doubt and trouble came.<BR>
Then, while loud laughter sounded up the hill<BR>
Where yet that ribald crew sang o'er the wine,<BR>

That in the moment of sheer certainty<BR>
My soul will die.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"No!  On thy spirit lay</SPAN><BR>
All the dark weight and mystery of pain<BR>
And all our human doubt and flickering hope,<BR>
Deathless despairs and treasuries of tears,<BR>
Gropings of spirit blindfold by the flesh<BR>
And grapplings with the fiend.  Else were thy death<BR>
Less like a God's than even mine may be.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Thou broken mother who canst see in him<BR>
Only the quiet man, the needful child,<BR>
And most of all the Babe of Bethlehem,<BR>
Let it suffice thee.  Thy reward is great.<BR>
Who loveth God that never hath loved man?<BR>
Who knoweth man but cometh to know God?<BR>
Thou sacred, sorrowing mother, canst thou learn&mdash;<BR>
Thou who hast gone so softly in God's sight&mdash;<BR>
Of me, the scarlet woman of old days?<BR>
Come, let us talk together, thou and I.<BR>
Apart, we see him darkly, through a glass;<BR>
Together, we shall surely see aright.<BR>
Bring thou thine innocence, thy stainless soul,<BR>
And I will bring deep lore of suffering,<BR>
My dear-bought wisdom of defeat and pain.<BR>
For out of these may come, believe it thou,<BR>
Sanctities not like thine, but fit to bear<BR>
The bitter storms and whirlwinds of this world.<BR>
Aye, out of evil often springeth good,<BR>
And sweetest honey from the lion's mouth.<BR>
And that he knew.  That very thing he meant<BR>
When he withdrew me from the pits of shame.<BR>
'T is I who see God shining through the man.<BR>
I see the deity, the godlike strength<BR>
In his supreme capacity for pain.<BR>
Nor have I known the cruel love of men<BR>
These many years to err when now I say<BR>
This man loved not like men but like a God.<BR>
Thou broken mother, weep not for the child,<BR>
Mourn not the man.  Acclaim the risen Christ!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She turned and touched the other lovingly,<BR>
Then stooped and peered into her darkened face.<BR>
The mother slept, forspent and overborne<BR>
By weariness and woe too great to bear.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She gently smiled.  "So it is best," she said.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Tall and elate she stood, her shadowy hair<BR>
Blown back along the darkness and her eyes<BR>
That searched the distant spaces of the night<BR>
Splendid and glowing with an inward joy.<BR>
And over that dark hill of tragedy<BR>
And triumph, victory and dull despair,<BR>
Over the sleeping Roman soldiery,<BR>
Over the three stark crosses and the two<BR>
Who loved Him most, the lily and the rose,<BR>
Shone still and clear the great compassionate stars.<BR>
